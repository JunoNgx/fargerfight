###Fargerfight

is an experimental local multiplayer game for smartphone, in which, both of the players participate with one single device, using one single touch. Each of the player uses their respective half of the screen to control their entity to deal damage to and defend against the opponent.

The game was made before I knew how to use git, hence only the last released version is pushed. It was also unprofessionally made, poorly written, confusingly organized, and there is no guaranteed that it would run on recent versions of Love2d. Ah yes, the nolstagia of youth.
