## Fargerfight

is an experimental local multiplayer game for smartphone, in which, both of the players participate with one single device, using one single touch. Each of the player uses their respective half of the screen to control their entity to deal damage to and defend against the opponent.

The project was completed in early 2014 (which was before I learned git, hence the only the completed codebase was pushed in one single commit in 2019) and [is currently published on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.junongx.fargerfight).
